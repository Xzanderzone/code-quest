                    - Hey Persile, Bonasi's name isn't actually Bonasi. I don't know his name either but he's crying in the bathroom, I think you should check up on him to clear the confusion.<br>
                    - Thanks for having the initiative of talking to me and helping your colleague, {{$user->name}}. - said Persile.

I remember the first day of classes, I arrived and was so stressed about meeting new people that I isolated myself sitting at an empty table. But now I already feel more confident in meeting new people. I am sure everyone feels like this, and they will be understandable about your little slip.<br>
                        - Oh, thank you for these kind words, {{$user->name}}. I feel that I have a friend on you! I'll go and explain to Persile that my real name is ‚ÄúYo-nasi‚Äù.

                        - Starting something new can be very stressful! On my first day, I was so worried about meeting new people. I remember feeling overwhelmed about the decision of where to seat, and you kindly looked at me and asked if I would like to sit with you. That made my day so much better and you showed such kindness that I am sure that everyone in the class will reciprocate in the same way when you tell them about your little slip.<br>
                        - Oh, thank you for these kind words, {{$user->name}}. I had no idea that I already had such good friends here! I'll go and explain to Persile that my real name is ‚ÄúYo-nasi‚Äù.
