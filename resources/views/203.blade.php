On the first day, I remember feeling overwhelmed about the decision of where to seat, and you looked at me and asked if I would like to sit with you. That made my day so much better and you showed such kindness that I am sure that everyone will understand when you tell them about your little slip.<br>
                        - Oh, thank you for these kind words, {{$user->name}}. I had no idea that I already had such good friends here! I'll go and explain to Persile that my real name is ‚ÄúYo-nasi‚Äù.
