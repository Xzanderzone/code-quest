You feel happy about your new programming skills and personal improvement, but also sad for leaving here, your everyday workplace on the past 7 months. You will miss your colleagues, the coffee breaks in the kitchen, the projects you did together, the jokes, laughs, the knowledge shared and the support on good and bad days.</p>
