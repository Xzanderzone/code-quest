                    <p>You are having a great time with your colleagues, while drinking a Tatooine Sunset.<br>
                    You look around to all these faces - Ziggy and her kind heart, always seeing the better side of things, Peeta having the best time of his life sipping on a Team Rocket couple's cocktail - and you realise that these are not your colleagues anymore, they are your friends.<br>

                    <p>You look around the room and smile. 7 months pass by so quickly! You remember the first day you entered this room, nervous around all these unfamiliar faces.<br>
                    You see Louis across the room, mimicking his tale about how he could definitely wrestle a horse and win. What a great class! You feel lucky to have met these people and hopeful that the friendship will continue outside CodeQuest too.

                    <p>You are watching Rust and Doodah giving a full-energy performance of Freestyler. While they rock-rock-rock the microphone, you realise how much you are going to miss your colleagues - no, not colleagues: your friends.<br>
                    You are the next on queue, prepare yourself to sing ‚ÄúMy Heart Will Go On‚Äù!
