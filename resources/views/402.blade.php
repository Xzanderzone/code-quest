                <p>Addventure sends you a file with everything that they expect to see on your project. The goal is to automate a hiring process in the company, making it easier for recruiters to access all information about candidates and positions.</p>

                <p>Our big project on this track is building a website. You have to choose one of the languages or frameworks that we learned on this track, and preferably combine 2 or more to challenge yourself!<br>
                You are going to work in groups and have 5 weeks to come up with a finished product.</p>
            @elseif($user->track === "Java")
                <p>Your first assignment is on the basics of Java. Some concepts overlap what you learned already, but you still need to create a good foundation for your career as a Java Developer.</p>
