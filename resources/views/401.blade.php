                <p>You are learning your way through Salesforce on the SnailHead platform. Your buddy, from the Addventure Company, is guiding you on this process and giving some moral support.<br>
                After a couple of weeks - and many points scored on SnailHead - it's time to prepare your business case and present it to Addventure.

                <p>Hi, fellow Full-Stacker! I am happy that you chose this path, which was also my choice when I was in your shoes. <br>
                Full-Stack is full of possibilities, you can mix front and back-end skills, becoming a jack of all trades.
                </p>

                <p>You are excited to learn new things on the Java Track! It is a different approach from the other tracks, you have to work more autonomously and look for information by yourself.<br>
                There is less guidance, but also more freedom, which means that you can set your own pace and even go beyond what the learning track initially proposes.
